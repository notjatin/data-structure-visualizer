### <u>(an aspired learning platform backed by 4 people)</u>

This name **"Dhanchu"** comes from the Hindi word "dhancha" ("**‡§¢‡§æ‡§Å‡§ö‡§æ**").

Dhancha means structure.

You must have heard of <u>"Data Structures"</u>.

And this app might be especially useful for you,

</ul>

Whichever the case be, this app is for you.

And of course, if you feel that the app serves another purpose for you, then please let me know.
